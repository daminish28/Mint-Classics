In this project, we do data analysis at the fictional Mint Classics Company,
helping to analyze data in a relational database with the goal of supporting inventory-related business decisions that lead to the closure of a storage facility.
We have imported the mintdb database and thus created the data model. Various queries were written in order to realize the true nature of the sales and inventory of the cars.
